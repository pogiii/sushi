# Introduction
Sushi is an open source alternative to [tamagui](https://tamagui.dev/)'s [Bento](https://tamagui.dev/bento).
But aiming to provide a more robust and complete experience in a way that is simillar [to shadcn/ui](https://github.com/shadcn/ui).

Sushi Isn't a component library, and will always use tamagui as a dependency.
Like shadcn/ui, you do not install it as a dependency and it won't be distributed via npm.

It is also required that you install and setup tamagui on your own before proceeding.

# Project Roadmap
The project is incredibly fresh but I will continue updating and adding more components.
I also want to mimick shadcn's CLI.
